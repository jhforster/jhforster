# This is my big post header and I hope you like it!

So if I were to write a paragraph about something... this is where I would do it. I am not sure what I'd write about though. Buckley? It'd probably be about Buckley. He is my son and he is currently a little nugget. But he gets bigger every day! There is a lot to say about him but I don't think I need to say it all right now. I'll leave it at that. More to come!

## This is an H2!
### This is an H3!
#### This is an H4!
##### This is an H5!
###### This is an H6!

I'd probably have other paragraphs in my post too, of course. It is rare for a post to only be one paragraph long after all. How many paragraphs in total? Well that's impossible to say. I primarily want enough so I can assess how this page is getting styled and to make sure I've accounted for everything. I think I'm close. Maybe a little more would be good. Ok, a cherry on top even. That's all. Fin. The end.

Well, not quite. I want another paragraph next to another paragraph so I can see how that looks. So I'm doing it. OK. There, it is done. Stop freaking out. Calm down everyone.

Of course, I'd also have lists! I love lists. Here are some thoughts on my favorite media sources.

1. The New Yorker – I love it
2. 99% Invisibile – so consistently interesting it blows my mind
   * I need to have an indented one here for testing too. I should make it long to see how it wraps and make sure that's good!
3. [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org) – aka the best blog on the internet
4. Austin Kleon – he hangs out in a lot of places and I follow him on all of them. Instagram, twitter, his blog, his newletter, you get it...

Not everything I do needs to be ranked or prioritized though! Sometimes, I just have thoughts!

* I don't like going to the gym (unless it is to use a sauna or steam room aka the "executive workout")
* I like to cook without using recipes when I can
* I wish I used my phone less but it is so interesting!
  * Working on it though!
* Ok, that is enough thoughts.

I, of course, need to try some `code block` stuff out too! I really have no idea how that will work but should be fun.

{% highlight ruby %}
  def foo
    puts "foo"
  end
{% endhighlight %}

Lastly, I should have some footnotes[^1] and blockquotes!
