Had an interaction yesterday that felt like the internet at its best. I [asked on twitter][t] for intros to user researchers who work across cultures / countries. Got referred to [Robyn Larsen][rl]. Ended up checking out her website where I found the illustrated print above, which I believe belongs to this [artist][a].

5 minutes of serendipity and clicking links into discovering a cool graphic and an artist to follow.

It ain't all bad online.
