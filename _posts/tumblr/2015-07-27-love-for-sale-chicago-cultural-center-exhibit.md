Saw this (free!) exhibit over the weekend. &nbsp;Cool historical component to it and a very distinctive and influential graphic style that spanned decades. &nbsp;I had never heard of Valmor before and had no idea of the cultural relevance. &nbsp;Highly recommend - the artwork has a very comic book vibe to it and must have influenced Shepard Faireyâ€™s style to some degree.
