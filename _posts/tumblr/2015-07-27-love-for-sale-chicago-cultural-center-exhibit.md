Saw this (free!) exhibit over the weekend. Cool historical component to it and a very distinctive and influential graphic style that spanned decades. I had never heard of Valmor before and had no idea of the cultural relevance. Highly recommend if you get a chance to see it - the artwork has a very comic book vibe to it and must have influenced Shepard Faireyâ€™s style to some degree.
