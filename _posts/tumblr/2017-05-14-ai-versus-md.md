[A.I. Versus M.D.](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md)  

Thought provoking article on the potential for machine learning to replace human diagnosis. The author does a nice job articulating that knowing what is different than knowing why. It does ultimately seem like the right pairing of our human and machine intelligence is what we are going to need to focus on soon.
