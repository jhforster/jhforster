I don’t consider myself religious. Maybe that’s my nature or maybe it was the nurture of being raised without going to Church. Probably a healthy dose of both. Who knows?

But as I’ve gotten older, I’ve been more open to considering the spiritual aspects of life. I feel a closeness to my late father, for instance, when running hard. Maybe the oxygen debt triggers old memories of running with him. Maybe it’s something else. But it is a pleasant phenomenon all the same.

I’ve been trying to listen to a wider variety of music. Gospel as a genre and Aretha Franklin as an artist qualify as a blind spot in my knowledge.

I don’t know enough about music to offer any commentary other than – this shit is spiritual. I played it the other morning and felt in a pleasant mood all day.
