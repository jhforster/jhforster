I stumbled into 9th Wonder’s Zion series of albums recently. So good. I love these sort of chopped up soul, hip hop beats that blend together. This song, SirBlue!!!, has been my favorite so far.

The albums remind me of [J Dilla – Donuts](https://open.spotify.com/album/7xJ7jHNu3JNfdnao9xwMho?si=ASBx-6kGTcmD7Lw6zpAe7w), which is high praise. Related to all of this, I just found out about the album [Dilla by Abstract Orchestra](https://open.spotify.com/album/2k03GJKwMPvBOXXL7gcvVf?si=-Jfhunn3SCa3m9VDHJ0X2A) and it is also phenomenal.
