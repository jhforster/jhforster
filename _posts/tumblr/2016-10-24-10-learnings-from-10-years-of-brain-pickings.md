[10 Learnings from 10 Years of Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/10/23/10-years-of-brain-pickings/)  

I always find myself wishing I had more time to digest the content on Brain Pickings so I enjoyed this concise list of themes and lessons.

1. Allow yourself the uncomfortable luxury of changing your mind.
2. Do nothing for prestige or status or money or approval alone.  
3. Be generous.  
4. Build pockets of stillness into your life.  
5. When people try to tell you who you are, don’t believe them.  
6. Presence is far more intricate and rewarding an art than productivity.  
7. “Expect anything worthwhile to take a long time.”  
8. Seek out what magnifies your spirit.  
9. Don’t be afraid to be an idealist.  
10. Don’t just resist cynicism — fight it actively.
