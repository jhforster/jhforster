It’s a common misconception that photographers are missing out on the moment by viewing things through a lens. What we’re actually doing is creating a deeper connection with our subject, studying it, observing it. Even in day-to-day life our eyes never rest, they’re always composing a scene out of whatever is in front of us. A curse and a blessing. credit @calsnape [http://ift.tt/1T2nTUu](http://ift.tt/1T2nTUu)
