[Bodyguard | Netflix Official Site](https://www.netflix.com/title/80235864)  

I really enjoyed this show. It is 6 episodes, which I appreciate, and it pulls you in right away. It is probably best described as a psychological thriller? But there is action, mystery, twists, and all sorts of stuff. No fluff – it is solid the whole way through and hard to guess where it is heading.

Plus, it has British people saying&nbsp;“ma’am” in a way that sounds like&nbsp;“mom” so it has that going for it too.
