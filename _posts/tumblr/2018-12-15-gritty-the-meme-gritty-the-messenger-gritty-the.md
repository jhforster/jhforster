[Gritty the Meme, Gritty the Messenger, Gritty the Messianic](https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/14/18140396/gritty-philadelphia-flyers-mascot-meme-leftist-icon-year-in-review)  

I couldn’t let 2018 come to a close without a Gritty reference. I don’t know how but Gritty is like the one thing to have gotten popular on the internet without also immediately being destroyed by the internet. Truly special.

Some highlights – [half court shot](https://twitter.com/GrittyNHL/status/1068665058694258688), [person of the year](https://twitter.com/GrittyNHL/status/1064958505151578112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1064958505151578112&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phillymag.com%2Fnews%2F2018%2F11%2F21%2Fgritty-time-person-year%2F), and [a little kid fighting Gritty, twice](https://twitter.com/davidehrlich/status/1064226171779514368).
