[Why Facts Don’t Change Our Minds](https://jamesclear.com/why-facts-dont-change-minds)  

I highlighted a _significant_ portion of this article. It feels particularly relevant to our current political climate.

> _Convincing someone to change their mind is really the process of convincing them to change their tribe. If they abandon their beliefs, they run the risk of losing social ties. You can’t expect someone to change their mind if you take away their community too. You have to give them somewhere to go. Nobody wants their worldview torn apart if loneliness is the outcome._

> _The way to change people’s minds is to become friends with them, to integrate them into your tribe, to bring them into your circle. Now, they can change their beliefs without the risk of being abandoned socially._
