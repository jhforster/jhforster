If you live in New England, give Walden Local Meat Co. some serious consideration. First, the quality is fantastic and you get a nice variety of items. But, more importantly, it is a good thing to do. The commercial “concentrated animal feeding operations” (CAFOs) are abhorrent in so many ways.

Based on their year end recap, it sounds like it is working.

> _This is the only region of the country in which the average age of farmers is declining, the average size of farms is decreasing, and the total number of farms is increasing – all signs of a revitalization of sustainable local farming._

It is a little expensive. But just eat less meat? Quality over quantity. Seriously, it tastes much better.
