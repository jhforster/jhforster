# Beaujolais Nouveau 

I don‚Äôt know a ton about wine, which means I occasionally get the pleasure of learning something new.

Within the span of a few weeks, I happened to hear a couple of people talking about ‚Äúbeaujolais.‚Äù I had never heard this word before. Turns out it is a region in France that produces wines. Makes sense.

Last night, my local wine shop was pouring a few Beaujolais Nouveau wines. And now I know this specific style of young wine is released each year on the third Thursday of November along with a corresponding celebration in the region. [This is a good overview](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelocal.fr%2F20181115%2Ften-things-to-know-about-beaujolais-nouveau-wine-france&t=NjRmNmM4YzM3NTM1ZGJmNzZmZDdkZTZmY2FlOGM3Njk4NDg2NDg0OCxjNDkyZGE0OWFhMzhkM2E5MGU1Y2UyZGQzNGRkMDcxYmUyNTNkN2Qz).

Anyways, it‚Äôs not my favorite wine ever but I like the annual tradition that accompanies it. Supposedly, the harvest this year was an unusually good one so I‚Äôm going to do my best to hunt down a few more bottles from different producers while I can. ‚ÄòTis the season. üç∑
