Beware … it’s #Fridaythe13th. Don’t break a mirror or let a black cat cross your path — unless it’s a spooky likeness of the one in this image by David Moreno Garcia (@deivitt). David lives in Barcelona, Spain, where his feline muse called Noir was adopted. “When I was visiting the shelter, he was the only cat that passed through my legs, as if he was choosing me,” David, who actually isn’t superstitious, says. Rather, he believes Noir brings good luck, despite the cat’s tricky ways. “He likes to climb over the highest parts of the house, and try to stay hidden, as if you can’t see him.”
