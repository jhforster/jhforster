title: The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making
  life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to
  make your soul grow, for heaven’s sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio.
  Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you
  possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.
