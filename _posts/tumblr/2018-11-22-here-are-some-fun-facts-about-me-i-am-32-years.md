Here are some fun facts about me.

I am 32 years old.

I have owned cars for 11 of my 16 total eligible driving years.

I have never owned a car with an Aux input or Bluetooth.

I mention these things because when I was commuting by car and only had access to a CD player, I burned CDs for my commute. Even in 2009, burning CDs was a pain and I never wanted to do it.

So I listened to this mash-up of The Beatles and The Wu-Tang Clan a lot. Like a real lot. All because I had somehow managed to burn it into a CD.

It’s amazing. I never _really_ loved either group. But I liked them both and I appreciate of the cultural and musical importance of each.

But I like this mash-up more than anything for either individual group. Blasphemous? Yea, probably.

Whatever. Who cares. I’m thankful for this mash-up.
