I pass this on my walk to the train. I’ve read a lot about morning routines – mostly in the form of “this famous person did X” or “do Y to be extra productive.”

But I’ve never really had a set routine myself. I do find that when I either exercise, read, or journal in the morning that it sets a nice tone for the day. So, it’s not a strict regimen but I do try to err towards certain behaviors.
