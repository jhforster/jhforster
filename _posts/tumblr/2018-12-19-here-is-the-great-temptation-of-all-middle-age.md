This excerpt from [A Diamond to Cut New York](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1995/06/26/a-diamond-to-cut-new-york)&nbsp;struck me (sidebar: the Dec 3rd issue of _The New Yorker_ that re-ran a lot of old pieces has been oddly fun).

This has happened to me a few times now. I’ll see something specific to the arts or advice for artists and find that it applies much more broadly if you reframe it. **Exhibit A:** Jerry Saltz’s&nbsp;“[How to be an artist.](https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/jerry-saltz-how-to-be-an-artist.html)”

Anyways, don’t get too comfortable.
