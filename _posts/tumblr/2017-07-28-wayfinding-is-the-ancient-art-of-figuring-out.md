> Wayfinding is the ancient art of figuring out where you are going when you don’t actually know your destination

— Bill Burnett and Dave Evans

I like the sentiment of this statement from [Designing Your Life](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful-ebook/dp/B01BJSRSEC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1501256727) and feels relevant to Product Management as well.
