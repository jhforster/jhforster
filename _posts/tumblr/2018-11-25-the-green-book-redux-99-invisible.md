The next time someone challenges you to explain “white privilege” – make them listen to this episode.

There is something simple, yet powerful, about hearing that to go on a road trip African American families needed a special book to know where it was safe to stop for food or stay for the night.

I know there are much more horrific examples from the 1950s and 60s. But something about learning about The Green Book just resonates. It’s like the smaller, everyday offenses are easier to digest.

I don’t know. Listen to the episode.
