> _Right for a right, wrong for a wrong  
> This is clearly not life’s design  
> Figure out quickly that nothing gets answered  
> When you ask the universe why  
> Life is a journey, to live is to worry  
> To love is to lose your damn mind  
> But living’s a blessing so I am not stressing_

Man, the thoughtfulness and the story telling of the lyrics in this song floor me. Every. Single. Time.
