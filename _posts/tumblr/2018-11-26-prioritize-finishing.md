I’m often juggling too many projects (or ideas for projects) at once. Combine that with a procrastination streak… and it doesn’t always yield the best outcomes.

“ **Prioritize finishing** ” is a new mantra of sorts I’ve been keeping in my head. It has helped me keep up momentum across tasks. It is akin to the “only handle it once” principle from _Getting Things Done_.

Basically, if there is a loose end wrap up or a project I can cross off the list – do it.
