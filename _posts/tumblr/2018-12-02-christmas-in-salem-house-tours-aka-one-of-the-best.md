AKA one of the best events of the year in Salem. It is organized by Historic Salem and really marks the start of the Christmas season in my mind. I like having a little time after Thanksgiving to decompress before jumping right into the next holiday.

This year focused on the Derby St neighborhood with 350th (!) anniversary of The House of Seven Gables and Nathaniel Hawthorne playing a particularly big role.

The house was turned into a museum in 1910 by Caroline Emmerton who used the proceeds to offer classes and workshops to the local immigrant community. She is a badass and her story is really cool. Worth a further look.

Anyways, it was a beautiful day with lots of other great historic homes and stories being featured too.
