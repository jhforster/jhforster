Photo: @ivankphoto // Manzanillo in the National Refuge of Vida Silvestre Gandoca-Manzanillo, in Costa Rica, in August of 2015. Costa Rica is using many types of renewable energy in an attempt to stop using fossil fuels. They have gone months without doing so, but this does not account for their vehicles. #CostaRica, #Environment, #latergram, #onassignment for @magazinegeo, @runa\_photos, @thephotosociety, @panospictures credit @thephotosociety [http://ift.tt/1pqkGSp](http://ift.tt/1pqkGSp)
