> “The best way to find out if you can trust someone is to trust them.” – Ernest Hemingway

I've thought about this a few times since coming across it. On the surface, trust seems binary – I trust someone or I don't. 

But that doesn't hold up under much scrutiny. Trusting someone to hold your spot in line is quite a bit different than trusting someone to watch your child, for instance.

So I'm going to try and default more to trusting people – in some capacity – from the start.
