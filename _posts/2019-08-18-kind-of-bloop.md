I'm not quite sure what to make of this? At a minimum, it is fascinating. And I love that someone took the time and effort to create it. It kind of works as an album?

I'm surprised this didn't get on my radar 10 years ago when it was first released. The timing is right now though – I just purchased a [Pocket Operator Arcade][po] and have been trying to learn how to make my own chiptune beats[^1]. A random but fun overlap.

Give it a listen.

[^1]: I have no musical talent but I've gotten a real kick figuring this device out. I'd recommend picking one up.
