"Stan culture" isn't really a topic I've thought much about. I've heard the terms for groups of fans – Beyhive, Beliebers, Little Monsters, etc. But that had been the extent of my knowledge. I did not fully realize the impact these rabid fan groups have on social media. 

As these random things always happen, I read [an article about this same topic in The New Yorker][stan] right after listening to this podcast.

> “You know how dope it would be if Nicki put out mature content? No silly shit. Just reflecting on past relationships, being a boss, hardships, etc. She’s touching 40 soon, a new direction is needed.” When Thompson got to the show, she put her phone away. By the time she checked it again, two hours later, her tweet had gone viral. 

That is barely even a criticism? Like what are we even talking about?

I guess my main thought on this whole topic is – don't let a single artist or piece of fiction define your whole identity. I loved Game of Thrones and found the last season disappointing. All well. I loved Kanye and have found some of his newer stuff weird. So what.

Would I have preferred Game of Thrones had an amazing ending? Yea, of course. Would I be happier if Kanye kept making undisputably classic albums? You bet.

But there are so many other shows and other music I want to explore anyways. I'll just do that instead of freaking out on twitter. Everyone relax.

It is funny to me people will say things like "I stan so-and-so." [Have you heard the song][eminem]? Stan isn't exactly portrayed in a good light.

And of course this has been going on forever.

> “Lisztomania,” coined in 1844, described the mass frenzy that occurred at Franz Liszt’s concerts, where audience members fought over the composer’s gloves or broken piano strings.
