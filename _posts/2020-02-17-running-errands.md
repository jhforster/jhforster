I find myself *literally* running errands with some frequency lately. This has been an unexpected perk of becoming a single car family since November 2018.

For instance, this morning I needed to drop our car off to be serviced. I dropped off the car at 8:15am and enjoyed a nice 7 mile run home. I was going to run today anyways. Two birds, one stone.

Or when my wife was pregnant with our son last spring, it was often more convenient to run the 4 miles to meet her at the OBGYN offices rather than making her come by and pick me up or spending money on an uber / lyft.

I started out of necessity but now I look for opportunities to pair my run with another chore I need to do. Pick up stamps? Why not jog a few miles first and grab them on my way back to the house? And so on.

It's a nice little combo when it works.
