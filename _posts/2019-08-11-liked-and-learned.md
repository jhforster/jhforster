## Liked
* **Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse**. Finally saw this movie. It was phenomenal. A+. Soundtrack is solid too.
* [The Lost Boy][tlb] album by YBN Cordae. I wasn't familiar with this at all until my brother recommended it. It is a nice listen. Lost & Found stands out.
* [The Busy Trap][tbt] article in NYT.
    * _"The Puritans turned work into a virtue, evidently forgetting that God invented it as a punishment."_
* Mid-August weather in the high 70s and low 80s without too much humidity. It was a perfect New England summer weekend. Even managed to snag a fantastic lobster roll from [Little Harbor Lobster](https://www.littleharborlobster.com/), which is currently in the lead for my favorite lobster roll in the area.
* [This entire radio station on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8EkajDP1rZZf?si=EQuBsEQFRFOYSkS12-kcow).

## Learned
* [How a garden buddha statue changed a neighborhood in Oakland][buddha]
* Styling embed links, particularly iframes, to be responsive to page width is way more complicated than it seems. I moved all of my old tumblr posts over to this self-hosted jekyll blog and that has been an unexpected complication. I'm going to work on fixing it next week. Happy with the transition overall, though.
* Related to above â€“ I realized need to clean up how the CSS for this site is organized. I've managed to grossly overcomplicate it.
* [Whimsical's](https://whimsical.com) sticky note stacks work well for [breadboarding](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding). We've been using this more and more lately at work and it is a great way to quickly explore an idea or workflow.
* Preeclampsia is scary. My wife is 39 weeks pregnant today with our first child. Two days ago, her blood pressure was up a bit (it quickly returned to normal and she and the baby are fine). It was enough to set off some internal alarms and mild panic. Having kids is complicated ***but*** we're almost done and he is almost here!
