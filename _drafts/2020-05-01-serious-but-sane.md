It has been a while since I last posted and some things have happened. Namely, a global pandemic.

ALl things considered, my wife and I are doing well. We still have our jobs. Buckley is happy and healthy. Nobody we know has contracted the virus. ðŸ¤ž

But it has been a strange and difficult time. Here is where I'm at these days.

We need to be serious about this virus. We need to be sane in how we manage through it. Shutting every non-essential thing down and forcing social distancing was necessarily as a way to buy ourselves time. But it isn't a solution that we can maintain indefinitely either.


We're both working from home without any childcare. It has felt like 3 phases for me.

Phase 1 â€“ around late Feb or early March, I found myself obsessed with following every piece of new data I could find. I'm not sure why. I would refresh, refresh, refresh. I guess it did help as we started taking it seriously earlier than most. Less twitter usage would have been good, however.

Phase 2 â€“ this stinks. Our anxiety had peaked. Watching Buckley while we were working was new and challenging. I had a slight cough during this part so I was isolating and stopped going out for runs. It was becoming clear that our government's response would be ineffective at best, negligent at worst. This stretch wasn't too fun. It also tended to be cold and rainy outside.

Phase 3 â€“ serious, but sane. This is my current mood. There is still a lot I can do despite the shutdown. I've learned how to cut my own hair. I'm getting some projects in the house done. I even baked some bread. If we all take smart precautions then we can hedge back towards some normalcy in the coming weeks and months.

So I'm taking it seriously. I wear a buff around my neck when I'm out for runs. But I only pull it over my mouth and nose when I can see someone.
